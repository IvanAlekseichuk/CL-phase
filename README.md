# Real-time phase detection for closed-loop EEG-TMS
Matlab Codes for resting-state EEG recording and 3 methods of real-time EEG phase estimation for closed-loop EEG-TMS: AR, ETP, FFT
Real-time EEG data acuisition through LSL (https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer). 
Triggers to the TMS machine are delivered from the parallel port on the computer using InpOutx64 DLL (http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/inpout32/).
